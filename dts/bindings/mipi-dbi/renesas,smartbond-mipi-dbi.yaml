  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Reset GPIO pin. Used to reset the display during initialization.

  te-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Boolean to indicate whether the tearing effect (TE) signal is available or not.

  te-inversion:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Boolean to apply an inversion on the TE signal that triggers the MIPI DBI controller.

  dma-prefetch:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Host controller will wait for at least the specified number of bytes before triggering
      a single update. The driver implementation will automatically calculate the max. number
      of bytes that can be prefetched. The prefecth mechanism should be enabled when the frame
      buffer(s) is stored in an external medium, e.g. PSRAM, that introduces delays during
      pixels fetching.

  layer-format:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Input color format. This color format should describe the frame buffer contents's color mode.
      The host controller is capable of performing on-the-fly color conversion.
      See dt-bindings/mipi-dbi/smartbond_mipi_dbi.h for a list.
